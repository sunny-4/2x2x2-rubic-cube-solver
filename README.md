# 🧩 2×2×2 Rubik’s Cube Solver

A Python project to solve the 2×2 Rubik’s Cube using multiple search-based algorithms:  
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **Bidirectional BFS**
- **IDA\*** (Iterative Deepening A*)

This project demonstrates state representation, search algorithms, and benchmarking for educational purposes.

## 🚀 **Features**
- Solves any valid 2×2 scramble with different algorithms
- Custom permutation system to represent cube states as simple strings
- Efficient face-rotation operations to generate next moves
- Benchmarked algorithms on speed, memory, and number of moves  
- Achieved up to **~30× faster** solving with Bidirectional BFS compared to basic BFS
